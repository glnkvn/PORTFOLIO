                    <p>A project is an individual or collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned and researched about by students. At schools, educational institutes and universities, a project is a research assignment - given to a student - which generally requires a larger amount of effort and more independent work than that involved in a normal essay assignment. It requires students to undertake their own fact-finding and analysis, either from library/internet research or from gathering data empirically. The written report that comes from the project is usually in the form of a dissertation, which will contain sections on the project's inception, analysis, findings and conclusions.</p>

                    <p>As my final year project I wrote a program for multiple robots to visit some predefined patients in a one-floor hospital in the minimum possible time without exceeding thier energy.</p>
                    <p>This project required:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Getting familiar with constraint programming languages</li>
                        <li>To modelled in Essence Prime language</li>
                        <li>Use the SAT solver implemented in Savile Row(which is a modelling assessment tool) to solve the problem</li>
                        <li>Each path can have different time</li>
                        <li>Robots energy would decrease by moving to a different location</li>
                        <li>No two robots can collide in their path</li>
